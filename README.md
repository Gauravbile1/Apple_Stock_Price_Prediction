# Apple Stock Price Prediction Using SVR  

This project predicts Apple stock prices using **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** models. It uses historical stock price data to train SVR models with three different kernels: **linear**, **polynomial**, and **RBF** (Radial Basis Function). The project also visualizes the actual data and model predictions.

## Features  
- Predicts stock prices using three SVR models.  
- Visualizes actual stock prices and model predictions.  
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of different SVR kernels.

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **scikit-learn**  
- **matplotlib**  
- **NumPy**

## Setup and Usage  

### Prerequisites  
Make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the dependencies using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

### Steps to Run the Project  
1. Place the stock data file (`aapl.csv`) in the project directory.  
2. Run the `app.py` file:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```  
3. View the plot generated by the script to analyze predictions from different SVR models.

---

## Data Description  
The dataset (`aapl.csv`) contains the following columns:  
- **Date**: The date of the stock price record.  
- **Open**: The opening price of the stock.  
- **High**: The highest price reached during the day.  
- **Low**: The lowest price reached during the day.  
- **Close**: The closing price of the stock (used for predictions).  
- **Volume**: The total number of shares traded.

---

## Results  
The script generates a plot that visualizes:  
- The **actual stock prices** as scatter points.  
- Predictions from:  
  - **RBF Model** (red line).  
  - **Linear Model** (green line).  
  - **Polynomial Model** (blue line).
